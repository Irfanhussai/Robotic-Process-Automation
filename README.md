This project focuses on the application of RPA using UiPath Studio to streamline the management of sales data. The primary objectives of the project are:

Automate Sales Data Entry and Storage: The project provides an interface for users to enter sales data, which is then stored systematically in an Excel file. This data is subsequently converted into a CSV file for ease of processing and compatibility with various data analysis tools.
Automate Sales Report Generation: Users can generate sales reports based on specific criteria such as the salesperson's name or a date range. The system processes these criteria, filters the sales data accordingly, and generates a comprehensive report in the desired format (Excel or CSV).
Support Word to PDF Conversion: The project includes a feature that allows users to convert Word documents into PDF format, ensuring that sales-related documents are securely stored in a widely accepted format
